# F-Gen
Simple Git repository containing anything I need to get up and running on an application quickly. This for the moment only directly supports console apps as that's all i've been doing- But more will be added in the future as I branch further out in F#.

## Instructions
Click use this template and then once you've followed those steps to get yours up and running, you can then run 
```.\FSharp-Genesis --create console```
and the following will be made-
- Dotnet project
- A basic Makefile
- GitIgnore file, with a notes section pre-ignored.
- .FSProj file with single file executable settings pre-written.

You are then free to run the cleaner script to remove the Readme and executable, (or do that manually) and get working!
